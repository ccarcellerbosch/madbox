## FunRace 3D
Test Unity/C# Developer

### Time spent
* Menus: 15m
* Game loop: 15m
* Coding: 3h
* Installing and learning game mechanics: 10m
* Installing Unity version: 45m
* README writing: 25m
* Push code to Git: 10m
### Difficulties
The PC has been slow during the installation of the Unity version due to the small free disk space. The pressure on having to do so much little things in a short time period has been a bit stressing but I enjoyed the challenge in the end. 
### What I could have done better
* To have time to develop an AI to play against.
* To have time to make the game with a better graphic quality.
### A step further
* Better settings (sound and vibrate)
* New game modes: endless level, replay old levels, multiplayer turn-based with the best times to complete certain level, etc.
* Sound and visual effects.
### My thoughts
I have done what I could in this short time period, but I would have liked to have known beforehand which version of Unity was needed to make the exercise.
### Comment
It has been difficult to understand if the most important part to develop was the source code itself or the user experience of the resulting game.
